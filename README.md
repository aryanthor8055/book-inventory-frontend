# Book Inventory Builder

A web application for educators and librarians to digitize book collections by photographing book covers and using Google Gemini Flash Vision LLM to extract book details. The application stores book data and images in MongoDB Atlas.

## Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- MongoDB Atlas account (free tier)
- Google Gemini API key
- Git

### Installation
1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/book-inventory-builder.git
   cd book-inventory-builder
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set Up Environment Variables**
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory based on the provided `sample.env`:
   ```env
   MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_atlas_connection_string
   GOOGLE_GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key
   PORT=5000
   ```

4. **Run the Backend**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. **Run the Frontend**
   In a new terminal, navigate to the project directory and run:

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, RTK Query, react-dropzone, Formik, react-toastify
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express, MongoDB Atlas, Mongoose, Multer, Sharp
- **AI**: Google Gemini Flash Vision LLM for book detail extraction
- **Database**: MongoDB Atlas (free tier)

## Design Decisions
- **MongoDB Atlas**: Chosen for its free tier and scalability, suitable for a single-user app. The document model aligns with flexible book metadata.
- **Image Storage**: Images are stored as base64-encoded buffers in MongoDB to simplify the architecture and avoid external storage dependencies.
- **Google Gemini Flash**: Selected for its generous free tier and effective vision capabilities for extracting book details from images.
- **Responsive Design**: Tailwind CSS ensures a mobile-friendly interface, meeting the PRD's web-responsive requirement.
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling for image and CSV processing, with user feedback via toast notifications.

## Out of Scope
- User authentication (single-user app)
- Advanced inventory management features
- Mobile app development (web-responsive only)

## Future Improvements
- Add user authentication for multi-user support
- Implement advanced search filters (e.g., by grade level or subject)
- Optimize image storage with external services like AWS S3 for larger collections
- Add export functionality to download inventory as CSV
